# Composey: Docker Compose to Terraform Compiler

> [!CAUTION]
> **Project Status: PRE-ALPHA**
> This project is in early development. APIs, models, and generated infrastructure are subject to breaking changes. Not recommended for production use yet.

Composey provides a PaaS-like deployment experience where application engineers deploy an annotated Docker Compose file into an established Environment. The compiler is responsible for inferring AWS infrastructure and generating deterministic Terraform JSON.

**The engineer describes intent; the compiler handles the infrastructure.**

---

## 🚀 Progress & Goals Tracker

### Compiler Pipeline
- [x] **Parse**: Sanitize and load Compose files via `docker compose config`.
- [x] **Normalize**: Transform Compose into a cloud-agnostic semantic model.
- [x] **Infer**: Map semantic intent + environment context to AWS resources.
- [x] **Generate**: Produce deterministic, canonical Terraform JSON.

### Managed Capabilities (v1)
- [x] **Container**: Standard ECS Fargate task deployment.
- [x] **Public HTTP**: Automatic ALB ingress routing for services on port 80/443.
- [x] **Secrets**: Automatic mapping of Compose `secrets` to AWS Secrets Manager.
- [x] **Storage**: Automatic mapping of `volumes` to AWS S3 Buckets.
- [x] **Managed Databases**: Automatically infers AWS RDS (Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB) from library images.
- [x] **Managed Caching**: Automatically infers AWS ElastiCache (Redis) from library images.
- [x] **Worker**: Support for background services without public ports.

### Quality & Guarantees
- [x] **Determinism**: Byte-identical output for equivalent inputs (canonical JSON/sorting).
- [x] **Isolation**: Full application-level network and identity isolation.
- [x] **Golden Testing**: Regression protection via example snapshots.
- [x] **Terraform Validation**: CI verification using `terraform validate`.
- [x] **Cloud Fidelity**: Integration testing via `LocalStack`.
- [ ] **Acceptance Testing**: Automated nightly runs in a real AWS sandbox. *(Pending)*

## 🛠 Design Principles

1. **Compose is the application DSL.**
2. **Environment is the infrastructure DSL.** (Owned by the Platform Team).
3. **Terraform is a compilation target.**
4. **AWS is an implementation detail.**
5. **The semantic model is cloud-agnostic.**
6. **Deterministic output is a feature.**
7. **Platform defaults are preferred over application configuration.**
8. **Developers describe intent, not infrastructure.**
9. **The compiler is stateless.**
10. **Every compiler stage is independently testable.**

> **Core Philosophy:** Every feature must reduce the amount of AWS knowledge required by an application engineer.

## ✨ Managed Capabilities ("PaaS Magic")

Composey doesn't just run containers; it intelligently substitutes cloud-native AWS services for common infrastructure components and supports intent-based scaling.

### 📊 Compute & Database Scaling
Composey supports the **`x-composey`** extension to allow engineers to specify the relative "size" of their resources without needing to know specific AWS instance classes or CPU/Memory units.

**Supported Sizes:**
- `small` (Default): 256 CPU, 512MB RAM | `db.t3.micro`
- `medium`: 1024 CPU, 2GB RAM | `db.t3.medium`
- `large`: 4096 CPU, 8GB RAM | `db.m5.large`

**Example:**
```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: my-app
    x-composey:
      size: large
```

### 🗄 Managed Databases (RDS)
If a service uses a standard database image (`postgres`, `mysql`, or `mariadb`), Composey will:
1.  **Substitute Infrastructure**: Provision an **AWS RDS Instance** instead of a container.
2.  **Automate Networking**: Create database subnet groups and security group rules automatically.
3.  **Dynamic Host Injection**: Automatically scan your application's environment variables. If it finds a variable pointing to the database service name (e.g., `DB_HOST: db`), it replaces it with the **actual RDS endpoint address**.

### ⚡️ Managed Caching (ElastiCache)
If a service uses a `redis` image, Composey will:
1.  Provision an **AWS ElastiCache (Redis) Cluster**.
2.  Automatically wire the endpoint into any application containers that depend on it.

## 📦 Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.14+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended)
- Docker & Docker Compose v2
- Terraform CLI

### Installation (Development)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GBurton/composey.git
cd composey

# Sync dependencies and install the 'composey' command locally
uv sync
```

### Compiling a Project
To compile a Docker Compose file, you must provide an **Environment** configuration (YAML) which describes the target AWS account context (VPC, Cluster, etc.).

```bash
# Basic compilation
uv run composey --file examples/flask/compose.yml --env examples/prod.yaml

# Short flags with custom project name and output directory
uv run composey -f compose.yml -e prod.yaml -p my-app -o build/terraform

# Show version
uv run composey --version
```

### Environment Configuration (`prod.yaml`)
```yaml
name: prod
vpc_id: vpc-12345678
public_subnets:
  - subnet-abc
  - subnet-def
private_subnets:
  - subnet-ghi
  - subnet-jkl
ecs_cluster_arn: arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:cluster/prod-cluster
alb_arn: arn:aws:lb:us-east-1:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/shared-alb/123
alb_listener_arn: arn:aws:lb:us-east-1:123456789012:listener/app/shared-alb/123/456
```

### Running Tests
The test suite includes unit tests, snapshot comparisons, and local cloud deployment verification via LocalStack.

```bash
make test
```

### Repository Structure
- `composey/compiler/`: The logic for each compilation stage.
- `composey/models/`: Pydantic schemas for Compose, Semantic, AWS, and Environment models.
- `examples/`: End-to-end examples that serve as documentation and "Golden" test snapshots.
- `tests/`: High-fidelity test suite (Unit, Integration, LocalStack).
